# Gender Discrimination in STEM Fields

## By: Clare Garberg, Clara Richter, Elise Rust, Kajal Tiwary

### Abstract

This research examines gender disparities in STEM across education, entrance into the workforce, and within the labor force. Many datasets were collected from a multitude of sources on different components of gender discrimination and were then thoroughly examined and transformed for visualization. Then, six visualizations were developed to illuminate how test scores have evolved at the education level, how the share of men and women entering professional fields have evolved moving into the labor force, and how labor force participation, fertility rate, parental leave, earnings, and technical skills in the labor force compare for men versus women and change over time. Overall, this analysis finds that gender divides are still present but are diminishing in education, entrance into the labor force, and within the workplace. Potential reasons for the narrowing gap include lower fertility rates and improved parental leave policies.
